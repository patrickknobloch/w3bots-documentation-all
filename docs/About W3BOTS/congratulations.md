# About W3BOTS

## Who We Are

W3BOTS is a team of passionate developers and blockchain enthusiasts dedicated to creating innovative, user-friendly Telegram bots tailored for the Web3 world. Our mission is to simplify blockchain interactions for everyone, from seasoned crypto veterans to new users exploring the space.

## What We Do

We develop smart, intuitive bots that run directly within Telegram. Whether it’s managing liquidity pools, tracking token investments, or simplifying community engagement, our bots streamline complex blockchain tasks with easy-to-use interfaces. From **Pooly**, our yield farming bot, to **Audity**, our comprehensive audit bot for TON and soon-to-be multichain support, we’re building a toolkit that empowers developers, users and investors.

## Why We Do It

Unlike many projects in the blockchain space, we are not motivated by tokens or monetary gains. Our goal is to create practical, transparent tools that promote decentralization and secure blockchain engagement. We believe in building sustainable, long-term solutions for the Web3 ecosystem without the typical "token grab" or speculative practices. W3BOTS is about empowering users and communities with tools that enhance security, usability, and trust.
