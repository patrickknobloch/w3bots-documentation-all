# How to Integrate Audity in Telegram Groups or Channels

Audity is designed to be versatile, offering users the flexibility to integrate the bot directly into their Telegram groups and channels. This feature enables community-driven auditing and security checks for tokens and smart contracts.

## Steps to Add Audity to Your Group or Channel

1. **Open Telegram**: 
   Navigate to your Telegram group or channel where you want to add Audity.

2. **Invite Audity Bot**:
   - Search for the official **Audity Bot** in Telegram.
   - Click on the bot and select "Add to Group."

3. **Set Up Permissions**:
   - Ensure that Audity has the necessary permissions to read messages and interact with users.
   - You can do this by clicking on the bot's name in the group, selecting **Edit**, and then configuring its permissions.

4. **Start Using Audity**:
   - Once the bot is added, group members can interact with it by typing commands such as `/audit <contract address>` or `/check <token symbol>`.
   - Audity will generate reports directly in the group chat, providing detailed analysis on tokens and contracts.

## Benefits of Using Audity in Groups and Channels

- **Real-time Auditing**: Group members can audit tokens or smart contracts without leaving the group.
- **Community Insights**: Promote discussions around the audit results, allowing group members to share their insights and collaborate on investment decisions.
- **Convenient Notifications**: Receive updates and alerts on tokens and contracts directly in the chat.

Audityâ€™s integration into groups and channels fosters transparency and community engagement, making it easier for users to make informed decisions.
