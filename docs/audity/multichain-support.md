# Multichain Support

Audity is designed to be versatile and expand beyond the TON blockchain. As blockchain technology evolves, users need auditing tools that can work across different ecosystems. Thatâ€™s why Audity is developing multichain support to provide more comprehensive security checks.

## Available Blockchains

Currently, Audity operates on **The Open Network (TON)**. However, multichain support is coming soon, and this will include auditing capabilities for other major blockchain networks such as:

- **Ethereum**
- **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**
- **Polygon**
- **Solana**

By incorporating multiple chains, Audity helps users audit projects across a wider DeFi ecosystem.

## How to Switch Between Chains

1. Access Audity through the Telegram bot or WebApp.
2. In the settings, select the blockchain network from the available options.
3. Once selected, all audits and token checks will apply to the chosen blockchain.

## Key Multichain Features

- **Token Audits**: Check smart contracts and tokens on different blockchains.
- **Liquidity Pool Analysis**: Evaluate liquidity metrics across chains.
- **Trading Pattern Detection**: Multichain wash trading detection ensures comprehensive oversight.
- **Holder and Token Analysis**: See detailed holder distribution on each blockchain.

Stay tuned as we roll out more blockchains and features in the next months!
