# Security & Privacy Policy

At Audity, your security and privacy are of utmost importance. This section outlines the steps we take to protect user data and ensure the highest security standards.

## Data Collection

Audity collects minimal data necessary for providing accurate audits and analyses. This includes:

- **Contract Addresses**: Submitted by users for auditing.
- **User Information**: Required for account creation in the WebApp, such as email addresses.

## Data Protection

- **Encryption**: All data transmitted between users and our servers is encrypted using industry-standard SSL encryption.
- **Storage**: Audity does not store sensitive financial data like wallet keys or token holdings. Only audit-related data is kept in our secure database.
- **Third-Party Access**: We do not share user data with third parties unless required by law.

## User Responsibility

Audity operates in a **self-custodial** mode, meaning users remain in full control of their assets. We recommend following best practices for protecting your wallet keys and personal data when interacting with smart contracts.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We encourage users to report any security vulnerabilities or suspicious activity through our [Support Center](insert link) to help us maintain a secure environment for everyone.
