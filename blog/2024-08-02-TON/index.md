## What is TON?

TON, or The Open Network, is a blockchain developed by Telegram, optimized for **speed, security, and scalability** to drive mass blockchain adoption. Key aspects include:

- **High Throughput**: TON processes up to 100,000 transactions per second, using a multi-blockchain structure. Its high throughput allows seamless transactions as user adoption scales.
- **Dynamic Sharding**: By dynamically balancing network load, TON achieves faster transactions and reduced congestion.
- **Built-In Services**: TON offers decentralized storage, DNS, and payment channels, simplifying dApp development.
- **Toncoin**: This native cryptocurrency powers transactions, fees, and staking on TON, supporting network security and participation.

## The Role of Telegram Mini Apps

Telegram Mini Apps are lightweight web applications within the Telegram app that enable users to access services without switching platforms. Mini Apps offer:

- **Easy Access**: Launch directly from chats or channels for a smooth user experience.
- **Rich Functionality**: They support tasks from polls to e-commerce and customer service.
- **Integration with Telegram Features**: Leverage notifications, secure messaging, and bot API for seamless, interactive experiences.
